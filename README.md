# Simple implementation of FibeRed manifold learning algorithm

Main algorithm of "Fiberwise dimensionality reduction of topologically complex data with vector bundles", by Luis Scoccola and Jose Perea.

Please see the notebooks the examples and the paper for a description of the algorithm.

Required Python packages for FibeRed: numpy, ripser, persim, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, procrustes, plotly.
To compute the Stiefel--Whitney obstructions you will need python-flint, which requires FLINT: Fast Library for Number Theory.

In order to run the examples you will need to download the data available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aI32Bh5hG3y_U7suQbqXrw7RZxs6y3Gi/view).
