# FibeRed: fiberwise dimensionality reduction

Simple implementation of the main algorithm of "Fiberwise dimensionality reduction of topologically complex data with vector bundles", by L. Scoccola and J. Perea.

Please see the notebooks for examples and the paper for a description of the algorithm.

Required Python packages for FibeRed: numpy, ripser, persim, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, qc-procrustes, plotly.
To compute the Stiefel--Whitney obstructions you will need python-flint, which requires FLINT: Fast Library for Number Theory.

In order to run the examples you will need to download the data available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aI32Bh5hG3y_U7suQbqXrw7RZxs6y3Gi/view).
